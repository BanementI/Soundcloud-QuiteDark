This CSS is used for the Stylus addon, but might be compatiable with others?

This is for my personal use, but people might find the fixes to be useful. If you are the author of the original script, make an issue if you want this removed.
Basically, this theme was really, really broken back in April or so. The author has sinced updated it, but I'm impatient so I run my own branch. Differences are very minor, but this is what I use for myself.
